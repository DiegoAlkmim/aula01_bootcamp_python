# Create a program where the user enter two numbers and it returns the sum of these numbers.

# Prompt the user to enter the first number
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_result}.")
